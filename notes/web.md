# Web

- a single-page app/site has one index.html, so it is a single page, but then JS is used to swap in/out elements to give the appearance of multiple pages, complete with routes etc. so the server just returns the whole thing, then when you switch pages it doesn't need to ping the server for a new html page etc.
